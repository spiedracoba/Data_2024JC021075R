DataForTable3:
Satellite-derived SST and its associated uncertainties were obtained from ESA SST CCI and C3S global Sea Surface Temperature Reprocessed products 
(https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00169) and downloaded from https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/SST_GLO_SST_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_010_024/services
These satellite SST time-series at each grid point were fitted to Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) 

Excel files show yearly b1 and b2 for oceanic and coast grid points after applying Eq. (4). They also includes Historical values of the coastal upwelling index (UI)
 at 43°N 11°W were obtained from http://www.indicedeafloramiento.ieo.es/HFNMOC/  

In order to study the influence of upwelling and downwelling processes on the interannual variability of SST, first we calculated the coefficients that define
 the seasonal variability by fitting the annual values of  SST to the first three terms of Eq. (3), i.e. ruling out the long-term trend term (Eq. (4). 
Then, Spearman’s rank correlations of the amplitudes of the annual (b1) and semiannual (b2) harmonics of SST with UIAS and UIOM were calculated.

Data for Spearman Correlation (Table 3) are presented in the following excel files:
